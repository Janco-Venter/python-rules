## Group 12 Python rules

### Readibility
- Use well defined varibale names
- Seperate clusters of code with newlines
- Function params compact foobar(a,b,c)
- Each line of code should fit an 800x600 monitor at 12px
- Docstrings for all non obvious functions
- Docstrings for all classes

### Code format
- Replace tabs with spaces
- Snake case for variables
- Define functione return types
- No deep nested classes
- Pascal case for classes
- Seperate functions and classes with two newlines
- Double quoutes for strings " "
- Use f strings f" "
- Always use self

### Practices
- Don't change varibale datatypes
- Don't re-use variables
- Use correctly scope variable. NO GLOBAL VARIABLES
- Put conditions in brackets with spaces
- No null variables
- Yoda conditions
- All imports at top of file
- No unnecesarry imports, specific imports
- No duplicate source for imports
- No list comprehensions beyond single aray scope
- Always start program with if __name__ == "__name__"
